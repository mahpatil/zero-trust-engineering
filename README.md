# Code samples for Zero Trust Security Engineering


This code repository contains code fragments and automation pipelines where appropriate that have been used in the [**Zero Trust Security Engineering**](https://bpbonline.com/products/zero-trust-security-engineering) authored by **Mahesh Patil** and published by **BPB Publications**.


Here is an overview of the book.

## About the book
In May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack led the U.S. President to declare a state of emergency. The attack led to vast fuel shortages across the country. Countless organizations have crippled their security, suffering devastating fines, penalties, and irreparable reputational damage. In 2025 alone, multiple brands were targeted by sophisticated ransomware attacks, causing significant disruptions and impacting their businesses, revenues, and customers.

Drawing inspiration from similar real-life instances, this book will provide you with all the knowledge you would need to build secure applications. You can apply these techniques regardless of whether your product is hosted on the cloud or on-premises. It will introduce you to the key concepts and requirements you need to know when building software products. 

This book explores how to integrate Zero Trust principles into your software development lifecycle, network, and operations, enabling you to build secure, resilient, and scalable. Harnessing the knowledge in this book will position you as a more brilliant, more strategic, safety-driven, and more effective engineer or leader.
