# Zero Trust Digital Payment Processing Solution

This repository contains a comprehensive digital payment processing solution built with zero trust engineering principles. The system consists of five microservices, each independently deployable as Docker containers.

## Architecture Overview

The solution includes the following microservices:

1. **User Management** - Handles user authentication and authorization with Google authentication
2. **Transaction Ledger** - Maintains secure records of transactions in compliance with data protection regulations
3. **Fraud Detection** - Utilizes machine learning and rule-based algorithms to identify suspicious activities
4. **Payment Gateway** - Processes payments securely and integrates with external payment providers
5. **Notifications** - Sends alerts and notifications to users based on transaction events or security alerts

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Deployment**: Cloud Run for serverless containerized applications
- **Database**: Cloud SQL with secure access controls
- **API Management**: Apigee
- **Messaging**: Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication

## Security Implementation

This solution implements zero trust principles throughout:
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Strict authentication and authorization for all services
- Least privilege access controls
- Continuous verification and monitoring
- Encryption for data in transit and at rest

## Getting Started

See individual microservice READMEs for specific setup instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Docker
- Gradle
- Terraform
- GCP Account with appropriate permissions

### Deployment

Each microservice can be deployed independently using the provided GitHub Actions workflows.

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform. See the `/infrastructure` directory for details.
