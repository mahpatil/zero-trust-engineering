# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Zero Trust Payment Processing solution.

## Zero Trust Security Model

Our implementation follows the core principles of zero trust:

1. **Verify explicitly**: All access requests are authenticated and authorized regardless of network location
2. **Use least privilege access**: Just-in-time and just-enough-access principles are applied
3. **Assume breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access to limit impact

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- Google OAuth 2.0 for end-user authentication
- Multi-factor authentication enforced for all users
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Token validation on every request

### Service-to-Service Authentication

- Service account-based authentication
- Mutual TLS between services
- Workload identity federation

### Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions
- Just-in-time access provisioning

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration

- Private subnets for all services
- No direct internet access for backend services
- VPC Service Controls to prevent data exfiltration

### API Security

- Apigee API Gateway for all external traffic
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request validation and sanitization
- OWASP Top 10 protection

## Data Security

### Encryption

- Data encrypted at rest using Cloud KMS
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for sensitive data

### Data Classification

- PII data identified and specially protected
- Payment card data tokenized and never stored directly
- Data retention policies enforced

## Secrets Management

- Google Secret Manager for all secrets
- Rotation policies for all credentials
- Least privilege access to secrets

## Monitoring and Detection

### Logging

- Centralized logging with Cloud Logging
- Audit logs for all sensitive operations
- Log retention compliant with PCI-DSS requirements

### Threat Detection

- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Real-time alerts for security events
- Integration with Security Command Center

## Secure CI/CD Pipeline

### Code Security

- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Software composition analysis (SCA)
- Peer code reviews required

### Build Security

- Signed commits required
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Artifact signing and verification

### Deployment Security

- Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- Immutable infrastructure
- Canary deployments

## Compliance

The system is designed to meet the following compliance standards:

- PCI-DSS for payment card processing
- GDPR for personal data protection
- SOC 2 for service organization controls

## Incident Response

- Documented incident response procedures
- Regular security drills
- Post-incident analysis and remediation

## Security Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Chaos engineering exercises
