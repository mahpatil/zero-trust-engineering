# Development Guide

This guide provides instructions for developers working on the Zero Trust Payment Processing solution.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17+
- Docker
- Gradle 8.0+
- Git
- Google Cloud SDK
- Terraform 1.5+

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/zero-trust-payment.git
   cd zero-trust-payment
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

4. Run the services locally:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow the GitFlow branching model:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement your changes
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Run local tests and security checks
5. Submit a pull request to `develop`
6. Address review comments
7. Merge after approval

## Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices

- Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

### Dependency Management

- Use only approved dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Check for security vulnerabilities before adding new dependencies

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for local development
- Use Secret Manager for production secrets

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use mocks for external dependencies

### Integration Testing

- Test service interactions
- Verify API contracts
- Test failure scenarios

### Security Testing

- Run OWASP dependency checks
- Perform static code analysis
- Test for common vulnerabilities

## Deployment

### Local Development

For local development, you can use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Development Environment

Deployments to the development environment are automated through GitHub Actions:

1. Push to a feature branch
2. Create a pull request to `develop`
3. After approval and merge, changes are automatically deployed to the development environment

### Production Deployment

Production deployments follow a more controlled process:

1. Create a release branch from `develop`
2. Perform final testing and verification
3. Create a pull request to `main`
4. After approval and merge, changes are automatically deployed to production

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging

- Use structured logging
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log appropriate context without sensitive data

### Metrics

- Monitor service health metrics
- Track business metrics
- Set up alerts for anomalies

### Distributed Tracing

- Use Cloud Trace for request tracing
- Monitor service dependencies
- Analyze performance bottlenecks

## Documentation

- Update API documentation when endpoints change
- Document configuration changes
- Keep architecture diagrams up to date
