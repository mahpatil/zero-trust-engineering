# Zero Trust Payment Processing Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Zero Trust Payment Processing solution, explaining how the system implements zero trust principles throughout the application lifecycle.

## System Architecture Overview

The system is built as a collection of microservices, each with a specific responsibility:

1. **User Management**: Handles user authentication and authorization
2. **Transaction Ledger**: Records and manages transaction data
3. **Fraud Detection**: Analyzes transactions for suspicious activity
4. **Payment Gateway**: Processes payments through external providers
5. **Notifications**: Sends alerts and notifications to users

## Zero Trust Principles Implementation

### 1. Never Trust, Always Verify

- All service-to-service communication requires authentication
- Every API request is authenticated and authorized regardless of network location
- No implicit trust based on network location

### 2. Least Privilege Access

- Each microservice has its own service account with minimal permissions
- IAM policies restrict access to only required resources
- Secret Manager controls access to sensitive configuration

### 3. Micro-Segmentation

- VPC Service Controls create security perimeters
- Private networking between services
- Apigee API Gateway controls and monitors all external access

### 4. Continuous Verification

- Real-time monitoring and logging
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular vulnerability assessments

### 5. Encryption Everywhere

- Data encrypted at rest using Cloud KMS
- TLS for all network communications
- Sensitive data tokenized when possible

## Infrastructure Components

### Networking

- VPC with private subnets
- Cloud NAT for outbound connectivity
- VPC Service Controls for resource isolation

### Compute

- Cloud Run for serverless containerized microservices
- Private service access
- Automatic scaling based on demand

### Data Storage

- Cloud SQL with private IP
- IAM database authentication
- Encrypted storage and backups

### API Management

- Apigee API Gateway
- API key management
- Rate limiting and threat protection

### Security

- Secret Manager for sensitive configuration
- Cloud KMS for encryption keys
- Cloud Armor for DDoS protection

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

- REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- JWT-based authentication for all API calls

### Asynchronous Communication

- Pub/Sub for event-driven communication
- Dead letter topics for failed message handling

## Deployment Strategy

The system uses a multi-environment deployment strategy:

1. **Development**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production validation
3. **Production**: For live operations

Each environment has its own isolated infrastructure with appropriate security controls.

## Security Monitoring

- Cloud Logging for centralized logs
- Cloud Monitoring for metrics and alerts
- Security Command Center for threat detection

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups
- Multi-region redundancy for critical components
- Documented recovery procedures
